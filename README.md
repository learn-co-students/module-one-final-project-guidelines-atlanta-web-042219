## Clean.ly - Tiffani and Andrew's Module One Project
A simple CLI app that allows the user to search for and return song lyrics, along with information regarding the presence of vulgarity or profanity. User can choose to replace instances of profanity with "clean" words to create their own version.

## Motivation
Devs (Tiffani and Andrew) wanted to design something simple and useful that makes use of a free public API, while demonstating knowledge of Ruby, SQLite3, and ActiveRecord "has-many-through" relationships.

## Features
* User Login/Password Authentication
* Song lyric search, with results that have profanity highlighted
* Profanity rating for each song based on the percentage of "bad" words
* Ability to replace profane words with "clean" words
* User can retrieve (and clear) recent searches
* User can enter new "bad" words for future searches, as well as modify replacement values for existing filter words

## Installation
Requires Ruby 2.6.3, along with installation of associated gems (bundle install)

## API Reference
[Song Lyrics API](https://lyricsovh.docs.apiary.io/#)

## How to use?
Clean.ly is a CLI app designed to be run from the user's terminal.
